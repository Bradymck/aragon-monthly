# [Aragon Monthly](https://monthly.aragon.one/)

Aragon Monthly is **a community curated monthly digital newspaper about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations** and the Aragon ecosystem.

## How does it work?

- Community members and Editors create [Issues](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/issues) for News, Articles and Classifieds
- Issues that get "upvoted" by the community get added a [bounty label](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/labels/bounty) and that bounty will be funded to incentivise fulfillment of that piece
- Anyone can contribute to creating the requested piece on Issues
  - By creating a new Pull Request that `Closes issue #x` anyone is free to claim the bounty on that Issue
  - Editors are members who are frequent high quality contributors and have priority over other contributors, they can assign themselves to Issues to signal their intent to fulfill that Issue
- At the end of the month the [Editor-in-chief](#contributors) makes sure that all completed [Pull Requests](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/pulls) are merged, compiles the Front Page and ensures that everything is working fine, publishes the Monthly to https://monthly.aragon.one/ and sends out the Aragon Monthly Newsletter
