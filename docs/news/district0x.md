**A fully decentralized peer-to-peer lending marketplace.** district0x is thrilled to announce our partnership with Bloom to create a fully decentralized lending marketplace, the Bloom Lending District. This district will offer a standardized, transparent, peer-to-peer method for requesting and funding loans, allowing anyone with access to the internet to lend and borrow funds free of central influence. There will be no middlemen, no fees, no cross border limitations, and no constraints and will not require access to the traditional financial system — truly unleashing the power of Ethereum. | | |
