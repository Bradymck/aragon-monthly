The team at Placeholder has years of experience in evaluating crypto projects and teams, and we are very proud to have their expertise onboard.

**Written reviews of what the team members have been up to.** Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that’s fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday’s meeting. | **Progress of development from the last quarter of 2017.** In the last quarter of 2017 we were heads down developing everything for the version 0.5 release of the Aragon Core app. Lots of progress was made, first audit of the smart contracts was conducted with good results and we’re on track to get the testnet release out really soon™. It has been an incredible quarter of building, in which we have laid down the foundation for everything that is to come in 2018. Brett and Pierre joined the development team, who together with Olivier are an amazing founding technical team. | |
