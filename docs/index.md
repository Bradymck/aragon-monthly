**Written reviews of what the team members have been up to.** Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that’s fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday’s meeting. | **Vitalik Buterin posts a new idea about DAICOs.** The idea is as follows. A DAICO contract is published by a single development team that wishes to raise funds for a project. The DAICO contract starts off in “contribution mode”, specifying a mechanism by which anyone can contribute ETH to the contract, and get tokens in exchange. This could be a capped sale, an uncapped sale, a dutch auction, an interactive coin offering, a KYC’d sale with dynamic per-person caps, or whatever other mechanism the team chooses. Once the contribution period ends, the ability to contribute ETH stops, and the initial token balances are set; from there on the tokens can become tradeable. | **Bringing private data to user-governed marketplaces.** At district0x, we have thus far largely avoided this issue by building marketplaces which rely mostly on already public cryptographic data (Name Bazaar), or relatively static information users are already comfortable making public (like freelancer or employer profiles on Ethlance). Where we’ve had to protect private data for supporting services within districts, we’ve done so with purpose-built solutions. |

**Auctus announces their plans to use and integrate with Aragon.** By deploying Auctus on the Aragon Network, it will be possible to protect Auctus and it’s community from any intermediary trying to abuse its power. Furthermore, it will avoid misunderstandings between agents, keeping full record of all decision making and financial decisions. It will also allow Auctus to become truly community driven, increasing the number of stakeholders, as well as decentralizing decision making and operational processes. | **A grants program to support the development of the ecosystems.** To help support the ecosystem flourish, we are introducing, together with Placeholder — lead by Joel Monegro and Chris Burniske — a grants program called Aragon Nest. The team at Placeholder has years of experience in evaluating crypto projects and teams, and we are very proud to have their expertise onboard. The goal of the program is to attract talent to research and build the necessary tooling for developing solutions around Aragon and Ethereum. | **A fully decentralized peer-to-peer lending marketplace.** district0x is thrilled to announce our partnership with Bloom to create a fully decentralized lending marketplace, the Bloom Lending District. This district will offer a standardized, transparent, peer-to-peer method for requesting and funding loans, allowing anyone with access to the internet to lend and borrow funds free of central influence. There will be no middlemen, no fees, no cross border limitations, and no constraints and will not require access to the traditional financial system — truly unleashing the power of Ethereum. |

The district0x project is building a general purpose framework of smart contracts and front end libraries for the purpose of deploying, operating, and governing communal marketplaces. The network is powered by Ethereum smart contracts, ‘Aragon’ governance and the distributed file system ‘IPFS’. The community has asked for a simple breakdown of the district0x network and the following post is based on this community feedback. Let’s dive in… |
